            <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
            <p>I was born in the beautiful Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, where I spent the first 40 years of my life. Following a career in Emergency Services, my family and I have made our home on the east coast of North Carolina.</p>
            <p>Just a few years ago, business led me to the east coast of North Carolina.  What was scheduled to be a 7-10 day trip, turned into a 3-week trip, then multiple return trips. Finally, my family decided to make our home here.  Although Oklahoma is our home, we enjoy life at the beach.</p>

            <h2>What I Like</h2>
            <p>I have never had too many hobbies.  I have always enjoyed my work and spent most of my time doing my job and spending off-time with my family.  But when I do decide to step out, I will probably be doing one of two things.</p>
            <p>I love going to concerts.  Live music is my best entertainment.  If there is not a good show in town, my second choice is riding my motorcycle.  If I can ride my bike to a concertâ€¦ the perfect day.</p>
