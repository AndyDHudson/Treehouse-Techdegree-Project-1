            <h2>Education Experience</h2>
            <p>I have always had an interest in technology.  While in high-school, I studied Computer Programming at my local Vocational Technical School.  I won’t tell you what year that was, but I will admit technology has changed a bit.</p>
            <p>After completing High School, I went on to college at a small university in southern Oklahoma.  There I studied Political Science while attending on a music scholarship.</p>
            <p>While in college, I developed an interest in Fire and Emergency Medical Services which led me to join my local volunteer fire department after graduation.  From there I attended the Oklahoma State University: Fire Service Training and three years of EMT and Paramedic education.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
              <p>I began working when I was in high school.  I landed my first job at the age of 15 years old.  I landed my first “real” job while I was in college.  I worked as a computer programmer for a local bank.</p>
              <p>After college I began volunteering with my local volunteer fire department.  After attending Fire Academy and Paramedic School, I began working with a fire department as a Professional Firefighter and Fire and Emergency Medical Service instructor with the University.</p>
              <p>After leaving the fire department a few years ago, I became a business owner and began working with other small and start-up business.</p>
